<h1>Warren Center R Workshop</h1>
<h2>Laptop Setup Instructions</h2>
<p>The R Workshop is less than a week away and we're very glad that you'll be joining us. This will be very much a "hands-on" event: we want you to leave with working code examples that you can adapt and expand upon to use in your own research. As such, make sure to bring your laptop and a power cable. Don't worry: I've checked and we have enough power outlets for everyone!</p>

<p>To help things go smoothly, I've come up with some instructions together with our speakers to help you get your machine set up in advance of the workshop:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Install R and RStudio</h3>
<p>You'll first need to download and install R from <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN</a>. In this workshop we'll interact with R via a front-end called RStudio so that everyone sees the same interface regardless of operating system. After installing R, you can download and install RStudio <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">here</a>. If you run into any problems, detailed video instructions are available for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX532N_XLIs">Mac</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD07NznguA4">Windows</a> on Youtube. If you're running Linux, we'll assume you already know what you're doing ;)</p>

<h3>Step 2: Familiarize Yourself with R and RStudio</h3>
<p>If you've never used R or RStudio before, don't panic! The first session will be an overview of R and we're going to do our best to make sure that you can still benefit from the workshop. If you've done a little programming in a language like python or matlab, you should be fine. If you haven't, that's ok too but it might be worth spending a little time familiarizing yourself with R and RStudio before the workshop. I recommend starting with the <a href="http://tryr.codeschool.com/">Try R</a> interactive tutorial from O'Reilly's Code School. It's free and doesn't require that you have R installed on your machine: you can do everything in a browser window. You may also want to take a look at my R Tutorials for Econ 103 at Penn. Links to the tutorials and solutions are posted <a href="http://fditraglia.github.io/Econ103Public/">here</a> (scroll down to "R Tutorials"). RStudio is fairly self-explanatory but if you've never done any programming before you may want to take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Px-6a7fetCg">this video</a> by Peter Rossi.

<h3>Step 3: Install R Packages</h3>
<p>During the workshop we'll use a number of <em>packages</em> to extend the functionality of R in helpful ways: <tt>pkgKitten, knitr, rmarkdown,</tt> and <tt>RcppArmadillo</tt>. The last of these, <tt>RcppArmadillo</tt>, is only needed for our final session on high performance computing. Since it's a bit harder to set up, I'll discuss it as a separate item below. In this step you will need to install the other three packages: <tt>pkgKitten, knitr,</tt> and <tt>rmarkdown</tt>. This is very easy to do using RStudio. Simply open the program and follow the instructions in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1r5XTqrCTQ">video</a>. Instead of entering <tt>modeest</tt> into the dialog box, enter <tt>pkgkitten</tt>. Then go back and repeat the same process for <tt>knitr</tt> and <tt>rmarkdown</tt>.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Install RcppArmadillo</h3>
<p>This step is only necessary if you'll be joining us for the final session on high-performance computing. This session will be a bit more technically involved as we'll be learning how to use C++ code from within R to speed up computationally intensive algorithms. If you're running Linux, setting up <tt>RcppArmadillo</tt> is easy: you already have all the necessary compilers on your machine so you simply need to install the package from within RStudio as in Step 3 above. On Windows, things are more complicated. Before installing <tt>RcppArmadillo</tt> from within RStudio, you'll need to download and install <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/">Rtools</a>. If you're running Mac OSX, you'll need to sign up for a free developer account with Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/register/">here</a>. Then you'll need to log in and install the Command Line Tools for Xcode. If you have trouble with any of this: don't worry. Talk to us on the first day of the workshop and we'll help you get things working.</p>
