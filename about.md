I joined the [Penn Economics Department](http://economics.sas.upenn.edu) in 2012 after completing my PhD studies with [Richard Smith](http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/people/crsid.html?crsid=rjs27&group=faculty) at [Cambridge University](http://www.cam.ac.uk).
Before transferring to Cambridge, I earned an MA in economics at [UC San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu), an MSc in statistics at the University of [St Andrews](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk) and a BA in economics and mathematics at the [College of William and Mary](http://www.wm.edu).
My research interests include econometrics, machine learning, empirical finance, and experimental economics.
