### About
I'm an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://economics.sas.upenn.edu) and a member of the [Warren Center for Network and Data Sciences](http://warrencenter.upenn.edu).
I came to Penn in 2012 after completing my PhD studies with [Richard Smith](http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/people/crsid.html?crsid=rjs27&group=faculty) at [Cambridge University](http://www.cam.ac.uk).
Before Cambridge, I earned an MA in economics at [UC San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu), an MSc in statistics at the University of [St Andrews](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk) and a BA in economics and mathematics at the [College of William and Mary](http://www.wm.edu).
My research interests include theoretical and applied econometrics, empirical microeconomics, and experimental economics.
