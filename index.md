I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://economics.sas.upenn.edu) and a member of the [Warren Center for Network and Data Sciences](http://warrencenter.upenn.edu).
<!-- I came to Penn in 2012 after completing my PhD studies with [Richard Smith](http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/people/crsid.html?crsid=rjs27&group=faculty) at [Cambridge University](http://www.cam.ac.uk).
Before Cambridge, I earned an MA in economics at [UC San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu), an MSc in statistics at the University of [St Andrews](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk) and a BA in economics and mathematics at the [College of William and Mary](http://www.wm.edu). -->
My research interests include theoretical and applied econometrics, empirical microeconomics, and experimental economics.
The main topics of my current and ongoing research are model selection and averaging, measurement error, and models with social interactions.
